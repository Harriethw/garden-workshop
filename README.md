# garden-workshop

## Can a website be a garden?

A workshop to build your own low-tech ‘digital garden’. 

In the same way that growing our own gardens can help us to understand our place in the ecosystem, and connect us to the material reality of the earth, so too can DIY website hosting help us to reflect on our place in the ecosystem of technology.

We will get together to create our own low-tech HTML ‘allotments’ that will be served on a DIY raspberry pi server.

People with no/low coding knowledge are welcome. 

Attendees are asked to prepare beforehand:

3 - 6 images/photos of three things you would like to place in their own digital garden - this could be your favourite plants, animals, beloved pieces of technology, your favourite celebrity. Things that you would like to plug into the mycelium network of the internet and spread your good vibes.
A laptop to type on - let us know if this isn’t possible, as we may be able to provide a computer.
